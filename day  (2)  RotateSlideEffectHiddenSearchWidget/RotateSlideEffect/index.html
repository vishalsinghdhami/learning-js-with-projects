        <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and probably were the first animals to be domesticated.Today, some dogs are used as pets while others are used to help humans do their work. Dogs are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, and listen well to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets.</p>

        <p>My pet dogâ€™s name is Bruno. He is from the breed of German Shepherds. He is 2 month old, fluffy and black and brown in colour.He gets delighted to see me when I come back from school.He protects our house from intruders, especially during nights.He spends most of his time with me and my Dad.
        He is very gentle with us but gets extremely aggressivewhen he spots a stranger.
        He goes with my father for morning walks and with me forevening walks.
        We provide him with healthy food, fresh milk and meat.
        I love him so much</p>
